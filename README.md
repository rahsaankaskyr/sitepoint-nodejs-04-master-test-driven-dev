 Keeping it real, with real-life TDD examples

Most Node developers are familiar with Test-Driven Development (TDD), but testing in Node can be a challenge. There are a variety of testing tools and frameworks available, but learning how to choose the ones you need and employ them with a TDD mindset is an entirely separate issue.

This course will teach you how to conduct unit testing in Node.js, using a TDD approach. You’ll be able to follow along through practical, real-life examples of test driven development, using a variety of testing frameworks, such as Mocha, Chai, Nock, Sinon, Lab, and Tape. These examples will provide you with hands-on experience with each framework, allowing you to use this course to choose the framework(s) that you need for your own project.

Using these testing frameworks along with your Node.js applications will result in well-tested, robust code, ready to survive in production. Whether you’re an old pro with unit tests and test driven development, or if it’s a brand-new idea, you’ll surely find something in this course that will spark your interest and improve your Node tests!
